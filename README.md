## Background
Chess is a two-person strategy game where each player attempts to coordinate their pieces -- pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queen, and king -- to attack the opposing king and prevent its escape, resulting in checkmate and the end of the game. Each of these pieces has a relative material value, commonly given as:
<center>
| Piece  | Value |
|  :-:   | :-: |
| Pawn   | 1 |
| Knight | 3 |
| Bishop | 3 |
| Rook   | 5 |
| Queen  | 9 |
</center>

In blitz chess, there is an added component of a clock that can cause a player to lose if they run out of time.
